# Tail-light-recognition-of-vehicles-by-using-pixel-operations

The developed algorithm is focused on extracting tail light in excessive sun light condition by developing clustering, flood filling, and multiple adaptive thresold segmentation. This development not includes any of feature based algorithm simply calculating pixels from lfet to right to mact the tail light by using PCA analysis. in order to remove un necessary noise from the environmnet various kind of filter were used.
